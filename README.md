# Library Management System SQL Project

This project is a SQL-based library management system designed to demonstrate skills in database design, querying, and data manipulation using PostgreSQL. The database structure includes tables for managing books, authors, users, borrowings, and more, alongside queries that showcase various SQL techniques.

## Data Insertion
This project includes pre-populated data in tables like Authors, Books, Users, and Borrowings to demonstrate SQL queries. You can find the data in the insert_data.sql file, which includes realistic data for testing queries.

## Queries
Explore the queries in the basic_queries.sql file to see basic and advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
